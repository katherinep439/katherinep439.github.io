<h1>About SpongeBob</h1>
<img src="spongebob_layingdown.png" style="width:30%">
<h2 style="text-align: center;"> SpongeBob SquarePants is an American animated comedy series created by marine science and educator Stephen Hillenburg. It officially aired on July 17th, 1999 on Nickelodeon. SpongeBob is the fourth longest-running American animated series in history, and the longest-running American children's animated series as of 2025. This alone should be enough to show the greatness of SpongeBob. </h2>

<h2 style="text-align: center">The show follows SpongeBob SquarePants who's a sea sponge who lives in a pineapple under ths sea. He is incredibly optimistic and joyful which is seen in most, if not all, parts of his life. He works as a fry cook in a fast food restaurant called the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob loves to catch jellyfish, blow bubbles, and is on obtaining a boat-driving license from Mrs. Puff's Boating School. Although recently he did obtain a license, he decided he was not in fact ready for the responsibilities of the road.</h2>
